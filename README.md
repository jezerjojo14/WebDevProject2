This website is called "Minimalist Origami Designs".
The content is completely satirical. The creator of the website is a character who makes origami designs that are really silly, but she/he takes herself/himself extremely seriously as an artist.

There are 4 pages that comprise the website:
1. There's an index page which I took to mean the home page. It contains a slideshow (given a wide screen) and a few words of welcome.
2. There's a showcase with images of the origami designs.
3. Then there's a blog or "journal" with a few posts.
4. Lastly there's the "Contact Me" page.
